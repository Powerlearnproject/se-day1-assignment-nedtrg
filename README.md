#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer: Software engineering is the practice of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems using structured methods. It ensures software is reliable, scalable, and meets user needs. Key activities include requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. In the technology industry, it’s crucial for creating high-quality software, ensuring security, and managing costs. Software engineers enable scalability, efficiency, and innovation while fostering collaboration across teams. Their work impacts sectors ranging from artificial intelligence to mobile apps, playing a pivotal role in economic growth and technological advancements. Overall, software engineering is essential for developing systems that drive modern technology.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer: The evolution of software engineering has been marked by key milestones that have shaped its practices and methodologies. 

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1960s): In the 1960s, software development was informal, often carried out by engineers working on both hardware and software. As software projects became more complex, the need for structured processes emerged. The term "software engineering" was coined during the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference, marking the beginning of formalized approaches to software development.

2. The Waterfall Model (1970s): In the 1970s, the Waterfall model introduced a structured, linear approach to software development. This model broke the process into distinct phases—requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and deployment—emphasizing a sequential flow. While it helped standardize development, the Waterfall model faced criticism for its inflexibility in adapting to changes during the development process.

3. Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s): In the 1990s and 2000s, the need for flexibility and faster delivery led to the rise of Agile methodologies. The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 promoted iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability to change. Agile approaches like Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) revolutionized software engineering by enabling shorter development cycles, improved collaboration, and the ability to respond quickly to evolving customer needs.

These milestones demonstrate the shift from informal practices to structured methodologies, and eventually to more adaptive, iterative development processes.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answer: The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to software development, ensuring quality, efficiency, and meeting user requirements. It consists of the following phases:

1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis: This phase involves collecting and documenting the software’s requirements from stakeholders, clarifying functional and non-functional needs. Analysts assess feasibility and define objectives before development starts.

2. System Design: Based on the requirements, the system's architecture, components, and interfaces are planned. The design is broken down into high-level (overall structure) and low-level (detailed components) specifications to guide development.

3. Implementation (Coding): Developers write the actual code based on design specifications. This is the longest phase where features and functionalities are built using appropriate programming languages and tools.

4. Testing: The software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix defects. Various tests, such as unit, integration, and user acceptance testing, ensure the software works as intended.

5. Deployment: Once testing is successful, the software is deployed to production, often in stages, to ensure smooth operation for end-users.

6. Maintenance and Support: After deployment, the software is maintained by fixing bugs, updating features, and supporting users to ensure the system remains functional and relevant over time.

These phases collectively ensure the software is delivered on time, meets requirements, and remains functional long-term.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answer: Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process with clearly defined phases: requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

1. Construction Projects: Building a bridge or a hospital, where the scope, design, and deliverables are well-defined from the start. Changes during construction are costly and impractical, so a sequential, step-by-step approach is best.
   
2. Government and Defense Contracts: Projects with strict regulatory requirements, such as developing military equipment or government software systems. These projects require detailed documentation and adherence to predefined specifications, making Waterfall an ideal fit.

3. Medical Software Development: For systems where safety and compliance are paramount, such as medical devices or healthcare management systems, where regulations dictate the design and testing phases upfront, and scope changes are minimal.

Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and flexible. Work is divided into sprints or cycles, with regular feedback from stakeholders to guide development. 

1. Mobile App Development: Developing a new app where user feedback is crucial for refining features and functionality. Agile allows rapid iterations and ongoing improvements based on customer input and market trends.

2. E-Commerce Platforms: For a company building an e-commerce website or platform, where requirements may change based on user behavior, new technologies, or business goals. Agile allows flexibility to adapt and deliver features in smaller, more manageable increments.

3. Startups: In fast-paced, innovative environments where product ideas evolve quickly. Agile helps startups continuously adapt to user needs and market changes, making it ideal for product development where uncertainty is high and speed is critical.

 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Answer: An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

Importance: Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.

An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.

An IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.

IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.

An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.

The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git.

Importance: Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.

Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 

Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Answer: Unit tests are close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.
- It ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
  
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - It helps to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
   
 System testing - Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 - It helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
   
 Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
 - ⁠Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Answer: Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Answer: Draw a picture of a person.

Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.

Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
